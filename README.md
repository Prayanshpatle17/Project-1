# Project-1
# Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
# This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts whether a person is at risk of diabetes based on key health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure. The model is built using Logistic Regression and deployed using Streamlit for a simple and user-friendly interface.
